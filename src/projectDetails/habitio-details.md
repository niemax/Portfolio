# **What is Habitio?** üì±

<br>

### Habitio is an app that makes you the best version of yourself. It makes you productive and therefore more balanced. Habitio makes it easy to control daily flow.

<br>

# **Why build something like this?** üë∑

<br>

### It's easy and often tempting to be lazy when you shouldn't. But to be productive daily, it certainly helps if you have someone or something to keep you motivated. This app with its notifications and progress tracking will keep you motivated. When you are productive, you get a lot more done and feel better overall. Even the small little things matter.

<br>

# **With Habitio I have achieved many benefits, such as:**

<br>

    1. Increased productivity
    2. Stopping procrastination
    3. Increased energy levels

<br>

# **Tech Stack** ‚ö°

<br>

    1. React-Native / Expo
    2. Persistent storage with AsyncStorage
    3. Styled Components
    4. JavaScript

<br>

# **How does it work?** ü§î

<br>

**Easy**, just download the app (not published yet) from App Store or Google Play Store. No account
creation is needed since the app only stores information on the device.

<br>

**Start habit creation.** You have two choices - choose from pre-defined habits within different
categories, or create your own.

<br>

**Configure** the options such as description or color. You can get the habit to be done only once
on a specific date, or you can add a goal for it. Configure the number of days you want to complete
it on. You can also choose from different units such as hours, pages, bottles - those are good for
different kinds of habits.

<br>

If you wish to set an end date and complete the habit as a routine between a specific time window,
you got it.

<br>

**Set a timer** to notificate you daily at a specific time. ‚è∞

<br>

**Track** your progress and edit the habit whenever you feel like it - change the color, change the
time of the reminder, delete the reminder, etc...

<br>

You can also add notes where you can tell about your previous completions, future goals, or
something else.
