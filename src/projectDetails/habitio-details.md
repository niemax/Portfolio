# **_How does it work?_**

<br>

**_Easy_**, just download the app (not published yet) from App Store or Google Play Store. Not
account creationg needed, since the app only stores info on the device.

<br>

**_Start habit creation._** You have two choices - choose from pre-defined habits withing different
categories, or create your own.

<br>

**_Configure_** the options such as description or color. You can get the habit to be done only once
on a specific date, or you can add a goal for it. Configure the amount of days you want to complete
it on. You can also choose from different units such as hours, pages, bottles - those are good for
different kind of habits.

<br>

If you wish to set an end date and complete the habit as a routine between a specific time-window,
you got it.

<br>

**_Set a timer_** to notificate you daily on a specific time.

<br>

**_Track_** your progress and edit the habit whenever you feel like it - change the color, change
the time of reminder, delete the reminder, etc...

<br>

You can also add notes where you can write down about your previous completion, future goals or
something else.
