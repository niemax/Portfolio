# **What for?** ü§î

<br>

This portfolio is meant to showcase my work but also give a short idea about who I am and what I am
as a developer and a person.

<br>

I've always wanted to build my own website and now that I have come to the point that I can build
one and, also wanted to learn **TypeScript**, I figured this would be the perfect opportunity to do
both. Overall I think the looks of this website describe me well as I like things minimalistic,
effective, easy-to-understand, and pretty much black-and-white but with a specific vibrant main
color and little animations.

<br>

# **Tech Stack** ‚ö°

<br>

    1. Gatsby (React)
    2. GraphQL
    3. Chakra UI
    4. TypeScript

**GatsbyJs** is definitely a very powerful framework for static sites with minimal data flowing like
these. I have really enjoyed working with both--**Gatsby** and **GraphQL**--as they are both
semi-new technologies and get the work done very efficiently and differ from a lot of frameworks out
there. Thanks to **Gatsby** and **Chakra UI**, my lighthouse scores for **accessibility**, **SEO**
and **performance** are both nearly 100 which is what I aim for. I love how accessibility--in my
honest opinion one, if not the most important aspect in software--is made effortless to create with
**Chakra**. Also I really enjoy the static typing TypeScript offers, and also, of course, the
compiler throwing errors in the right time.
