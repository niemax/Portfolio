      Jumped into the world of Information Technology in 2019. {"\n"} Ever since it has been the one
      thing that I'm super passionate about. Always looking for new creative ways to build
      accessible and smooth software for all kinds of people with all kinds of end devices. Also
      constantly trying to better myself on clean code principles. I'm always eager to learn,
      especially from better programmers.
